          <h2>Ancient Egypt</h2>
          <p>
            <strong>Ancient Egypt</strong> was a civilization of ancient
            Northeast Africa. It was concentrated along the lower reaches of the
            Nile River, situated within the contemporary territory of modern-day
            Egypt. Ancient Egyptian civilization followed prehistoric Egypt and
            coalesced around 3100 BC with the political unification of Upper and
            Lower Egypt under pharaoh or king Menes (often identified with
            Narmer <sup>2</sup>). The history of ancient Egypt unfolded as a
            series of stable kingdoms interspersed by periods of relative
            instability known as "Intermediate Periods"

          <h2>Ancient Rome</h2>

          <p>
            In modern historiography, ancient Rome is the Roman civilisation
            from the founding of the Italian city of Rome in the 8th century BC
            to the collapse of the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century AD.
            It encompasses the Roman Kingdom (753–509 BC), the Roman Republic
            (509–27 BC), and the Roman Empire (27 BC–476 AD) until the fall of
            the western empireAncient Rome is often grouped into classical
            antiquity together with ancient Greece, and their similar cultures
            and societies are known as the Greco-Roman world. Ancient Roman
            civilisation has contributed to modern language, religion, society,
            technology, law, politics, government, warfare, art, literature,
            architecture, and engineering. Rome professionalised and expanded
            its military and created a system of government called res publica,
            the inspiration for modern republics such as the United States and
            France
