        <h2>Museum's history and purpose</h2>
        <p>
          museum, institution dedicated to preserving and interpreting the
          primary tangible <b>evidence of humankind</b> and the environment. In
          its preserving of this primary evidence, the museum differs markedly
          from the library, with which it has often been compared, for the items
          housed in a museum are mainly unique and constitute the raw material
          of study and research. In many cases they are removed in time, place,
          and circumstance from their original context, and they communicate
          directly to the viewer in a way not possible through other media.
          Museums have been founded for a variety of purposes: to serve as
          recreational facilities, scholarly venues, or educational resources;
          to contribute to the quality of life of the areas where they are
          situated; to attract tourism to a region; to promote civic pride or
          nationalistic endeavour; or even to transmit overtly ideological
          concepts. Given such a variety of purposes, museums reveal remarkable
          diversity in form, content, and even function. Yet, despite such
          diversity, they are bound by a common goal: the preservation and
          interpretation of some material aspect of society’s cultural
          consciousness.
